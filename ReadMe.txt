The Amharic Poem Wax and Gold Meaning-Detector is an NLP tool designed to analyze the intricate metaphors and meanings within traditional Ethiopian poetry. It tries to identify and interpret the complex layers of meaning that are often present in Amharic poetry. With its user-friendly interface, it makes it easy for researchers, academics, and enthusiasts to delve deeper into this rich cultural tradition and gain a deeper understanding of the nuances of Amharic poetry. Whether you are a student or a scholar, it can be used as an initial starting point for working with it in your NLP projects and/or research.

Scope:
Only takes into account the semantic level of the Amharic poem's context.

Provide an Amharic WordNet with a small number of senses and be specialized for the purpose of prototype testing.

Use only one of several techniques to obtain the wax and gold meanings, namely Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), to solve the meaning of double-meaning words (ህብረቃል).

Limitations:
It doesn't address Amharic poem that employs techniques of joining words or splitting words.

It doesn't work for double-meaning words (ህብረቃሎች) that don’t exist in the corresponding Amharic WordNet.

In our case, when two or more dual-meaning words appear in the same Amharic poem, which is a rare occurrence, it is impossible to pinpoint the precise term dedicated to the poem.


Future work can improve the limitations by providing:

An integrated Amharic morphological analyzer, 
An Amharic spelling and grammar checker, and 
An algorithmic solution for detecting the exact double-meaning word  (ህብረቃል) with its wax and gold meanings when two or more appear in a given Amharic poem.
