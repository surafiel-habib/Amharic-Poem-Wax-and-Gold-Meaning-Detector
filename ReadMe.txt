Introducing the "Amharic Poem Wax and Gold Meaning-Detector," an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) instrument meticulously crafted to dissect the intricate metaphors and nuances concealed within traditional Ethiopian poetry. Its primary purpose is to discern and unravel the multifaceted layers of significance that often enshroud Amharic poetry. With its intuitively designed interface, this tool provides an accessible gateway for researchers, scholars, and enthusiasts alike to plunge into the depths of this culturally rich tradition. It facilitates a profound comprehension of the subtleties woven into Amharic poetry, whether one is a diligent student or a seasoned academic. It also serves as a preliminary cornerstone for those embarking on NLP projects or engaging in dedicated research endeavors.

Scope:
The tool exclusively engages with the semantic essence embedded within Amharic poetic contexts.

It offers an Amharic WordNet featuring a curated selection of senses, tailored explicitly for prototype testing purposes.

Employing the technique of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), it proficiently addresses the challenge of deciphering dual-meaning words (ህብረቃል), a crucial component of the "wax and gold" metaphor.

Limitations:
It does not encompass Amharic poems that employ word amalgamation or segmentation techniques.

For dual-meaning words (ህብረቃሎች) absent from the corresponding Amharic WordNet, the tool's efficacy is constrained.

In instances where a rare occurrence unfolds, featuring two or more dual-meaning words within a single Amharic poem, precise identification of the specific term dedicated to the poem becomes an elusive pursuit.

Future enhancements hold the potential to transcend these limitations through the incorporation of:

An integrated Amharic morphological analyzer

An Amharic spelling and grammar validation system

An algorithmic framework tailored to identify exact instances of dual-meaning words (ህብረቃል) and unveil their respective "wax and gold" interpretations, even when encountered multiple times within a given Amharic poem.
